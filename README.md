# LifeData
Everything about manipulation of personal life data coming from smart devices

I'm in the process of consolidating several sources of data, accrued during years, in a single one (or, at least, fewer ones).

Data are about my life parameters, sport performances etc.

First step is to recover data from existing apps, and then merge then in a single set. I don't plan to write a Life Data management app, but, at least to regain ownership of my own data ;-)

## SproWeight - Weight and fat data

SproWeigth is a simple, but effective, iOS App to collect Weight, Fat and temperature data. It allows a morning reading and an evening reading. Data format is now closed, therefore I'ma abandoning it and getting the data out.
